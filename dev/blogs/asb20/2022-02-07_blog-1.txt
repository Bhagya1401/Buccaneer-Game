Assigned actions
==============

Action 1: To investigate the options for saving Java objects to persistent storage.

	I looked at a range of different options out there to save Java objects to persistent storage and narrowed it down to 3 main options that could be useful. 

	Those options are the following:
		- Native serialization
		- XStream
		- gson

	Each have their own benefits and I'll explain them during the next meeting.
