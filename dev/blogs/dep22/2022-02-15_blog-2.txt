Assigned actions
================
Action 1: continue with presentation for UI mock ups

I had the game specifications on one screen and the presentation on the other and I read through and implemented as I found something new for UI. This took a while due to trying different programs to design the game and reading though the specification multiple times.

Hours: 3


Other project work

learning new programs to design and produce a game board mock up.

Hours: 1

Total hours: 4
