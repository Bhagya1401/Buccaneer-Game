Assigned actions
====================

Action 1:  Baggy (with or without Dean) will develop a plan for successfully finishing the project.

	
	I specified the project plan and made it less vague so that there would be a clear a direction that project was going towards.

	Hours: 2


Action 2: Baggy will get confident with Gitlab Issues and will allocate tasks between
group members to fix User Interface Specification and Test Specification
before deadline.


	I asked Dean for some assistance on how to create issues but in the meantime I let the team know what issue they had to fix in the test and UI spec via discord

	Hours: 2

Action 3: Baggy will speak to Chris about skipping some of the requirements from
group project because of lack of people.

	Ash said he had some ideas about what to remove from the project and therefore I left him with the task of emailing Chris

Action 4: Baggy, Ash, James and Maciek will meet to review Design Specification
tomorrow (1st April).
 

	The design spec was reviewed by myself and Maciek and submitted to Gitlab

Action 5:  James, Ash and Baggy will prepare plan for coding all the project parts and
allocate tasks to all group members.

 	James, Ash and I were able to create a rough plan for coding the project, but not all of the tasks were allocated
