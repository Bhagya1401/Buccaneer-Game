Assigned actions
====================

Action 1: Read "Buccaneer Online Board Game Requirements Specification" to get an understanding of the game

I read the requirement specification to get a better understanding of the rules 
and appearance of the board game and created a rough draft of what the UI may look like.

	Hours: 1

Action 2: Read SE.QA.04 and start work on material for the user interface document.

I read SE.QA.04, identified the Typical Users that would interact with
the program and deduced that the only users are the players. I then started to think 
about the use cases for each player paying attention to how users will navigate and interact with the game. I also updated my original UI draft.
