Week 6: 16/03/22

Assigned actions
================
Action 1: Maciek, Mateusz, Dean and Baggy will meet and review Test Specification.

This was completed and I reviewed the test spec and the only thing wrong that i could find is the document format which they changed.

hours: 1

Action 2:  Dean will get confident with Gitlab Issues.

I played around with the gitlab issues and set some issues that need to be sorted for the group

Hours: 1

Action 3:  Dean will prepare spreadsheet of initial tasks and time spent on these tasks.
If essential, he will allocate or reallocate tasks to other group members.

I realised what I did wasnt what was asked.
I think i did this right but it took so long to go through everyones blogs and record what tasks they are doing and how long it took them.

hours: 4

Other project work
