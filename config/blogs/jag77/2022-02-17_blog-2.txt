Assigned actions
===============


Action 1: Continue development of the GUI by adding a menubar, graphics, 
and a popup of some kind
This involved me researching how to add a menubar and graphics,
spending time working out how I wanted to implement it alongside debugging.

I have also added a small amount of functionality for character movement
and something resembling turns.
